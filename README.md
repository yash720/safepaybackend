## 🛠️ Known Issues & Future Roadmap

### ❗ Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)
- **Voice Detection Accuracy in Noisy Environments**
  - Real-time voice scam detection performance may degrade in environments with background noise, echo, or multiple speakers. Advanced noise filtering and speaker diarization are in progress.
- **QR Scanner Compatibility**
  - The current QR scanner may not work optimally on low-end mobile devices or outdated browsers due to hardware constraints or lack of camera access permissions.
- **Scam Heatmap Precision**
  - The scam location heatmap relies on IP-based geolocation which may not always reflect the user’s actual physical location accurately.
- **Limited Dataset for Regional Languages**
  - Scam messages and voice datasets are primarily in English or Hindi. Accuracy may be lower for regional dialects like Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.
- **Model Bias**
  - Early ML models are trained on a limited set of labeled scams and may exhibit bias toward known patterns, missing novel fraud strategies.
- **No Offline Support Yet**
  - The platform currently requires internet connectivity for AI service calls, limiting its utility in poor-network areas.
- **Mobile Responsiveness Under Testing**
  - While the frontend is responsive, full UI testing across all screen sizes and OS/browser combinations is ongoing.

### 🔮 Upcoming Enhancements & Features (Planned)
- ✅ **UPI App Integration (Deep Linking)**
  - Direct integration with Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and BHIM for seamless UPI redirection and safer in-app payments.
- 🧠 **Adaptive ML Models with Real-Time Learning**
  - Fraud detection models will adapt and retrain incrementally based on user feedback and newly flagged scam reports, enhancing system intelligence over time.
- 👆 **Biometric Verification for High-Risk Transactions**
  - Add fingerprint/face ID verification for transactions exceeding custom risk thresholds, enhancing user-level fraud mitigation.
- 📡 **Real-Time Scam Broadcasting**
  - Users in nearby regions receive push alerts when a scam is reported or confirmed, enabling proactive defense.
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption for Sensitive Logs**
  - Sensitive communication (voice recordings, UPI details) will be encrypted and anonymized in storage.
- 📊 **User Risk Scoring System**
  - Every user or UPI ID will have a trust/risk score based on behavior, reports, and transaction history to aid scam prevention.
- 🔎 **Explainable AI for Scam Detection**
  - Add model explainability layer so users can understand why a QR/voice/message was flagged as suspicious.
- 📱 **Native Mobile App (iOS + Android)**
  - Dedicated mobile app version under development for better performance, offline access, and biometric security.
- 🔍 **WhatsApp/Telegram Scam Link Detection**
  - Integration with messaging apps to detect suspicious links, shortened URLs, or scam groups in real-time.
- 👥 **Community Reporting & Validation System**
  - Crowdsource scam validation by allowing verified users to upvote/downvote or flag suspicious entities or numbers.
